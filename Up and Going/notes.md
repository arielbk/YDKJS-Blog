# Notes for (You Don't Know JavaScript - Up and Going)[https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch2.md]

I will probably try to get through this first book quickly because I have worked with JavaScript a little bit before and I have a grasp some of the more foundational programming ideas.

But that's it, they are foundational. That's why it is necessary for me to go through and revisit from time to time. I will be typing (not copy and pasting) and testing out all the code snippets I come across also.

## 7 types in JavaScript:
- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null` and `undefined` (interesting that these two are listed together)
- `object`
- `symbol` (this is apparently new in ES6... I'd never heard of it)

I can use `typeof x;` to find out the type of a value, it returns a `string` value.
`typeof null;` returns `"object"`; apparently its a bug.

## Objects
