These are my notes for the infamous book series - You Don't Know JavaScript. You can view the original books [here](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/).

As I go through the books, I will follow along with the concepts, code snippets and insights. This is a place for me to store all of this for myself and perhaps help others. I hope to understand things better by trying to explain them simply and effectively.

These notes may be useful to someone that has gone through a book but wants to quickly peruse some of the main points as a refresher.

This is not a replacement for the books themselves; these are just my notes. Go and read through the books yourself if you haven't already; I've heard they're really good.

If you notice any mistakes or weak areas (grammar wise *or* if you think I have miscomprehended or misrepresented a concept) please make a pull request and correct the changes. I encourage anyone out there to improve these notes.
